Subject: Capstone Progress Update – Serverless URL Shortener Backend

Hi [Stakeholder Name],

Here’s a quick update on our capstone project:

✅ We’ve completed the modular Terraform setup for all AWS components:

- API Gateway (custom domain, WAF-protected)
- Lambda functions (create/retrieve)
- DynamoDB, CloudWatch, SNS, IAM roles

✅ CI/CD is fully enforced via GitHub Actions:

- Validation on pull request
- Deployment on merge to `main`
- Branch protection and CODEOWNERS active

✅ Governance is documented in `README.md`, `GOVERNANCE.md`, and `SECURITY.md`

- All resources tagged for auditability
- IAM scoped with least privilege
- Alerts and tracing enabled

Next steps:

- Final QA critique and unit tests
- Recruiter-ready summary and demo

Let me know if you’d like a walkthrough or have feedback.

Best,  
Shilpa
